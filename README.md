```
For setting up my preferred working environment. Some highlights include:

- Gnome desktop (transparency-enabled terminal + apps + extensions + wayland)
- Pop Shell (tiling)
- Vim / Neovim (no extensions (we use unix as IDE), just basic vimrc stuff. slowly transitioning to neovim)
- Firefox (default browser)
- Brave (secondary browser)
- Obsidian (only using this for viewing rendered markdown files)

```
